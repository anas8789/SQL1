
 Primary Key       


 <1> What is Primary Key
 
   primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table. A 
   database table must have a primary key for Optim to insert, update, restore, or delete data from a database table. Optim 
   uses primary keys that are defined to the database. However, you can also define primary keys to supplement those in the database. 


 
 <2> Benefits of a primary key

   :- helps identify unique data, such as a customer ID;

   :- prevents duplication of records in a table;

   :- helps with updating or deleting only specific records;

   :- helps ensure that fields aren't null;

   :- helps set up relationships between tables; and  
      ensures row-level accessibility. 



 <3> Example


   1>
	Create Database Company
	Use Company
	CREATE TABLE Employee (EmpId int primary key, Name  varchar(20),Age int,Salary int )
   	insert into Employee values (01,'Saeed',20,10000)
	Select * from Employee

       
          Result

            EmpId |  Name  |  Age |  Salary
             
             01      Saeed    20     10000 



 

 Foreign Key

 

 <1> What is Foreign Key

    :- A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a database table that creates a link between data in two tables.It 
      acts as a reference to the primary key in another table.

    > It enforces referential integrity, meaning it ensures that the value in the
      foreign key column must match a valid primary key in the referenced table.

    > It helps maintain consistent and related data across tables.



 <2> Advantage and Disadvantage of foreign Key

     Advantages

        :- Data Integrity
           Ensures that records in related tables remain consistent (e.g., you can't insert an order for a non-existent customer).



        :- Prevents Orphan Records
           Foreign keys prevent records from being left without a related parent (e.g., an order without a customer).

     
     Disadvantage 

       :- Complexity in Design
          Managing multiple foreign key relationships can make the schema harder to understand and maintain.


       :- Dependency Issues
          Deleting a parent record can be restricted if child records exist, unless cascading is used.


  <3> Example 

    
       Create Database IT
       Use IT

       CREATE TABLE Departments (
       DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       DeptName VARCHAR(20)
);

   
       CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       EmpName VARCHAR(20),
       DeptID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);


     INSERT INTO Departments VALUES (1, 'HR'), (2, 'IT');

     Select * From Departments

     INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (101, 'Saeed', 1);

     Select * From Employees 


       Result 
     
        
         * Departments
       
            DeptID | DepName
   
              1         HR
              2         IT  
  

         * Employees 

           EmpID | EmpName | DeptID
