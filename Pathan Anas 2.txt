  A Stored Procedure (SP) is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements
  that you save and reuse in a relational database like SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle.


 Points:

  * Stored in the database under a name.

  * Can include SQL queries, logic, loops, conditions, and even error handling.

  * Supports input/output parameters.

  * Enhances performance, security, and code reuse.
